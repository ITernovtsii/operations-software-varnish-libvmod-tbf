* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and using vmod-tbf. It is *not* intended as a replacement
for the documentation, and is provided as a brief reference only.
For accessing complete vmod-tbf documentation, see the section
'Documentation' below.

* Overview

This module implements token bucket filtering for Varnish Cache.
Token bucket filtering (TBF) allows for controlling the rate of
data traffic.  The following example illustrates the use of
this module in VCL script:

    import tbf;
    
    sub vcl_recv {
        if (!tbf.check(client.ip, "10 req/1s")) {
            error 429 "Request rate exceeded."
	}
    }

This will keep the incoming HTTP traffic at the rate of 10 requests
per second.

Additionally, this module provides several auxiliary functions for
checking load average of the machine, getting system time, formatting
UNIX timestamps in human-readable form, etc.

* Installation

In order to compile the package you need to have Varnish source tree
configured and compiled, and the Berkeley DB library.  The minimum
prerequisites are Varnish 3.0.1 and BDB 4.2.

Supposing that the varnish source tree is available under
/usr/src/varnish-3.0.1, run:

  ./configure --with-varnish-source=/usr/src/varnish-3.0.1

The `--with-varnish-source' option is mandatory: it tells configure
where Varnish sources reside.

Once configured, do
  
  make

This will build the module.  After this step you can optionally run
'make test' to test the package.

Finally, run the following command as root:
  
  make install

* Documentation

The manual page vmod-tbf(3) will be available after successful install.
To read it without actually installing the module, run
`man src/vmod-tbf.3'.

An online copy of the documentation is available from
http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/vmod-tbf.
